description: Maintain and diagnose ChatBar prompt text, templates, builders, assembly, and request ordering across PromptTemplates, PromptAssembler, cache layers, history grouping, RAG cards, World Book outlets, Archive/HEAD injection, and final ChatApiMessage serialization. Use whenever adding, editing, deleting, renaming, or moving any model-facing prompt in PromptTemplates.kt; also use for prompt section order, roles, headings, caching, previous-turn placement, RAG usage notes, or when actual model input differs from a preview.

# ChatBar Prompt Pipeline

Treat the serialized API message list as source of truth. Constant declaration order and assembled preview text do not prove what the model receives.

## First Read

- Phase 4 main-chat Prompt text/builders and section labels: authoritative `app/sharedCore/src/main/kotlin/com/example/chatbar/domain/prompt/MainChatPromptAuthority.kt`; Android `app/app/src/main/java/com/example/chatbar/domain/prompt/PromptTemplates.kt` retains the upstream-compatible facade. Character NAI default-negative authority is the separate shared `CharacterNaiPromptDefaults.kt`. Other auxiliary Prompt families remain Android `PromptTemplates`-owned until their own domain extraction.
- Section collection, layer rendering, RAG cards, outlets: authoritative shared `app/sharedCore/src/main/kotlin/com/example/chatbar/domain/chat/PromptAssembler.kt`
- History and previous-turn grouping: app/sharedCore/src/main/kotlin/com/example/chatbar/domain/chat/ContextWindowManager.kt
- Final logical role/message insertion and cache-key boundary: authoritative shared `app/sharedCore/src/main/kotlin/com/example/chatbar/domain/chat/MainChatRequestAssembler.kt`; Android `ChatViewModel.kt` prepares platform/runtime inputs and delegates, then launches transport
- Desktop Phase 4 fake-runtime orchestration: `app/desktopApp/src/main/kotlin/com/example/chatbar/desktop/DesktopFakeChatRuntime.kt`; it persists/reads real Desktop chat state, resolves shared Context/WorldBook/Prompt inputs, delegates final ordering/cache key to `MainChatRequestAssembler`, and captures only transport-neutral logical requests. It is not a provider/transport implementation.
- Desktop Phase 4 read-only inspection: `DesktopChatRequestPlanner.kt` is the common Desktop planning authority used by fake runtime and `DesktopPromptInspector.kt`; Inspector uses non-repairing repository reads and `MainChatRequestAssembler.messageTrace` provenance, exposing logical messages/cache/WorldBook evidence without persistence. It is not provider serialization.
- Per-model format prompt placement enum: shared `app/sharedCore/src/main/kotlin/com/example/chatbar/data/local/entity/FormatPromptPosition.kt`; Android `ModelConfig` references the shared type
- Cleartext HTTP final role adaptation: app/app/src/main/java/com/example/chatbar/domain/chat/CleartextHttpChatTemplatePolicy.kt
- Request diagnostics: app/app/src/main/java/com/example/chatbar/utils/DebugLogManager.kt and ui/chat/DebugLogDialog.kt
- Core tests: PromptAssemblerCharacterModeTest.kt, ContextWindowManagerTest.kt, CurrentTurnMessageOrderTest.kt, RoleplaySpeakerPromptTest.kt, PromptTemplatesTest.kt, and CleartextHttpPolicyTest.kt

Use chatbar-long-term-memory when Archive, HEAD, timeline constraints, source-turn boundaries, or RAG grouping are involved. Use chatbar-novelai-prompt for NovelAI tag-design prompts and chatbar-character-card-ai for card-generation prompts.

## Ownership Model

- Auxiliary text/vision requests use AiTaskMessageAssembler's fixed eight-message GENERAL_* envelope: system → assistant → user → assistant → user(actual input) → assistant → assistant → user. The first system joins GENERAL_SYSTEM_PROMPT, all feature system contents in order, then GENERAL_CREATOR_IDENTITY_SYSTEM_PROMPT. Non-system messages become the fifth user; multiple messages carry original-role headings, while multimodal parts retain their order and objects. A single user input is preserved verbatim. Main chat keeps separate CCB assembly. AiTaskContext/profile supplies logging identity; profile boundaries are not inserted by this envelope. The exact envelope is idempotent and remains request-only.
- PromptTemplates also owns characterRewriteOutputSchema, characterResearchSummary, worldBookPromptSummary, worldBookQueryContext, novelAiRevisionWithCharacterReference and indexedImageDescription. Scene services retain serialization and business validation; editable model-facing prose belongs in these builders.
- IMAGE_DESIGN/GENERATE is the role-preserving exception: keep non-system input messages between the GENERAL_* prefix and tail instead of merging them into one user. This retains successful planner scene output and real revision history as assistant messages. REPAIR and all other kinds keep the eight-message merged-input structure. Envelope recognition accepts the variable-length input block to prevent double wrapping.
- GENERAL_* replaces the former AI_TASK_* confirmation constants. Feature generation/repair systems remain the protocol owners. Main-chat SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE, POST_HISTORY_INSTRUCTIONS_TEMPLATE and CCB constants use their separate committed wording; auxiliary envelope changes must not rewrite them. Stored user/card prompts are not rewritten.

- Automatic chat images use local completion checks before NovelAI design. Legacy `AutomaticChatImageJudge`, `AUTOMATIC_CHAT_IMAGE_JUDGE_SYSTEM`, and `automaticChatImageJudgeUser` remain available but are not called by the automatic-image flow.

- Keep Phase 4 main-chat model-facing text in `MainChatPromptAuthority`; keep non-migrated auxiliary task text in `PromptTemplates`. Never create a second Android/Desktop copy of moved main-chat literals.
- Do not duplicate the Character NAI default-negative text: `CharacterNaiPromptDefaults` is its physical Prompt-domain authority, and Character transfer production policy delegates to it.
- Treat the `AI 提示词目录` KDoc at the start of PromptTemplates as mandatory navigation metadata. Every PromptTemplates prompt change must review it; add, remove, rename, recategorize, or revise entries in the same change whenever symbols or purposes change. Use exact searchable symbol names and never line numbers.
- A PromptTemplates prompt change is incomplete until the header directory remains accurate. Keep template constants beside their builders so directory search lands in one local area.
- Keep section selection, titles, and layer assignment in shared `PromptAssembler`.
- Keep final logical `ChatApiMessage` roles/order and stable-prefix cache-key derivation in shared `MainChatRequestAssembler`. Android `ChatViewModel` only prepares platform/runtime inputs and delegates. `StreamingChatService` adapts later system roles and merges a trailing requirement into the current user only for opted-in `http://` requests; Debug Request JSON records this adapted transport body.
- Keep conversation grouping in ContextWindowManager and shared turn policies.
- Verify transport request fields with chatbar-model-request-runtime.

Do not move behavior between these owners without tracing every caller and test.

## Layer Invariants

- Core contains the resolved character-card system prompt plus CCB creator identity. `systemPromptTemplate(overrideContent)` always retains `SYSTEM_PROMPT_PREFIX` and `SYSTEM_PROMPT_SUFFIX`; cards replace only `SYSTEM_PROMPT_REPLACEABLE_CONTENT`, and `{{original}}` inserts only that default middle content. Blank overrides use the default middle. Character, supplementary and player settings are separate logical system messages; reply constraints belong only to positioned requirements.
- Chat request uses separate character, setting-reference (World Book + non-CHAT_MEMORY RAG), supplementary, player, reply-constraint, and memory-RAG fields. Legacy `dynamicSystemPrompt` remains an aggregate for compatibility; never inject it alongside these request fields.
- Final logical order: core + creator identity → CCB first ack / contract / confirmation → optional START requirements → character → World Book + setting RAG → supplementary → player → CCB context approval → Archive → earlier history → memory RAG → HEAD/timeline → previous turn → CCB continuation → current user → character post-history + optional END requirements → optional format-card strong suffix → CCB assistant/user tail.
- CCB continuation is a standalone system immediately before the real current user. Its existing next-user wording remains valid. Archive is independent before the history heading; memory RAG is after earlier history.
- Move a complete adjacent USER + ASSISTANT previous turn into the tail hot zone when available. Earlier assistant history may omit status and option blocks when configured, but every assistant message in the previous turn must retain its full content. Preserve opening assistants, consecutive users, unanswered users, and other abnormal messages in original order.
- Resolve the active format card by available entities: use an available session override first, then an available global default; a stale session ID must not suppress the default card.
- Build current-turn requirements once through `PromptTemplates`, then combine with the assembler's reply-length/language constraints and reply-tail length/speaker requirements. START is after CCB contract confirmation, before character; END is after the current user and character post-history; BOTH uses the exact same text twice. No separate reply constraints remain in character settings. Missing persisted values default to BOTH.
- Format-card random-number tools remain a request-only suffix inside the current user message. Extract every STRONG_PROMPT_SUFFIX in configured order into one logical system after character post-history/END requirements. CCB assistant acknowledgement and user identity reminder follow; the reminder is always the last logical message.
- Derive the prompt cache key from the exact logical prefix through CCB context approval, including roles, conditional START, World Book/setting RAG and all settings. Edits or retrieval changes alter the key. Archive, history heading and END remain outside that prefix.
- Render session placeholders in separately inserted Archive and HEAD text before creating their final `ChatApiMessage`; keep persisted memory text unchanged.
- Cleartext HTTP adaptation changes the non-trailing strong-prompt system and other later system roles to assistant. The final CCB reminder remains user, so cleartext and HTTPS requests both end with user.
- Omit empty sections and their headings.
- Base cacheability on rendered stable content. An unresolved World Book outlet in stable content disables stable-prefix caching.
- Keep cache keys aligned with the exact sent prefix through context approval.

## RAG Rendering

- Partition cards by ChunkSourceType, not display labels.
- Render non-CHAT_MEMORY cards before CHAT_MEMORY cards.
- Inject RAG_CHAT_MEMORY_USAGE_NOTE once, immediately before the first memory card.
- Do not add the memory-card note to document cards.
- Keep card numbering continuous after partitioning.

## Workflow

### World Book request scan

- shared `WorldBookRequestPlanner` reloads explicitly linked books each request. For duplicate IDs, a linked repository book wins over an embedded copy; first book occurrence still defines book order. Android `ChatViewModel` delegates to this planner; Desktop consumes the same authority. Editor drafts do not replace saved books.
- `ChatRepository.getWorldBookScanSnapshot` reads enough recent messages for maximum book/entry scan depth independently of direct chat context; timed effects use full indexed message count, excluding a regeneration target. Non-persisted current input participates in scanning.
- shared `WorldBookEngine` scans displayContent; enabled/character filters, delay, sticky/cooldown, keys/secondary keys, probability, per-depth group competition, recursion and per-book token budget govern selection. Blank keys never match; nullable whole-word settings inherit from the book. Sticky activations preserve their original deadline. Timed maps use book-ID + entry-ID keys and read legacy entry-only keys for compatibility.
- World Book reasons and source book IDs/updatedAt are included in existing request retrieval diagnostics (`ragDebugLogs`). OUTLET selections still require a matching placeholder. BEFORE_CHAR/AFTER_CHAR define internal ordering in the user's unified post-character World Book block.
- Entry caseSensitive and matchWholeWords are nullable: null inherits the book, explicit true/false overrides. Existing persisted booleans retain their values; the entry editor and draft materialization preserve all three states.
- `WorldBookScanContext.fromCard` supplies opt-in description/personality/scenario/creator-notes/persona matching sources. Structured description uses character descriptive fields; personality uses habits/speakingStyle; scenario uses basicSetting. Freeform cards use current editable importer sections 人物描述/性格特点/背景场景; unsectioned text is description and examples are excluded. Persona uses the active session/global player setting; placeholders render before matching. Both primary and secondary keys inspect selected sources, including with scanDepth=0 and during recursion; source text itself is not injected as lore.
- `WorldBookTransferService` owns both standalone and character-embedded import. Matching options load from entry root or extensions and survive ST export. `WorldBookEntryModalState` exposes/preserves all five extra-source flags. Regression coverage: WorldBookMatchingOptionsTest.

1. Read the PromptTemplates header directory and classify the change as prompt text, section assembly, turn grouping, cache behavior, or transport.
2. Write expected final message roles and order before editing.
3. Trace both assembleSystemPrompt and assembleCachePromptLayers callers.
4. Update or verify the header directory in the same change for every PromptTemplates prompt edit.
5. Check direct chat, regeneration, cache fallback, and empty-section paths.
6. Add behavior tests for inclusion, omission, relative order, and role.
7. Inspect serialized Request JSON when delivery or ordering is disputed.

## Regression Matrix

- No history, one incomplete turn, and multiple complete turns.
- Format prompt placement at START, END, BOTH: START before character, END after current user and character post-history, BOTH at both positions; length/language/speaker constraints move together.
- Opening assistant, consecutive users, unanswered user, and regeneration.
- Empty-message continue: read the latest persisted message; if USER, reuse its body/images and ID as current input, excluding it from history without duplicate persistence or a continue instruction. Otherwise use request-only `PromptTemplates.continueGenerationUserPrompt()`. Format-requirement placement follows the resolved model configuration.
- Format-card user tools: direct send, multimodal send, regeneration, and empty-message continue keep random values inside the real current user, then append one configured strong-prompt system followed by the CCB assistant/user tail; retries reuse already assembled random values.
- Empty versus populated World Book, RAG, Archive, HEAD, and post-history sections.
- Stable outlet present versus absent.
- Document-only, memory-only, and mixed RAG cards.
- Cache path and non-cache fallback produce equivalent semantic order; cache key covers exact stable role/content sequence.
- Cleartext HTTP serialization preserves non-trailing message/content order, adapts the strong-prompt system to assistant, preserves the final CCB reminder user, and never ends with an adapted assistant prompt.
- Expected Archive and HEAD markers exist in final serialized messages.

## Stop Conditions

- Do not infer order from SECTION constants.
- Do not accept preview-only evidence for a request-delivery bug.
- Do not change source-turn grouping without checking direct context, RAG, and long-term memory together.
